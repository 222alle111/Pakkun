# Capstone: PAKKUN
As a pet owner like myself, I struggle keeping track of my pet's information like food log, weight log, etc. This app will help other pet owners like myself who needs their pet's information right way instead of sreaching everywhere for them or maybe you just don't remember on the spot. PAKKUN is the app that will store your pet's important information, think of it like a mini pocket notepad right off the tip of your fingers and just one click away.
